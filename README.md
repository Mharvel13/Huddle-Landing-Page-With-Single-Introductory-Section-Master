## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned

The major thing i learned during this project was how to set a  background-size of an background-image of an element using values 

```css
.body {
  background-image: url("images/bg-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 90%;
  background-position: center;
}
```

### Useful resources
